                posture. The goal is to help organizations improve their
                security by highlighting areas where they are vulnerable to
                attack. This information can be used to develop mitigation
                strategies and improve the overall security of the organization.

                A public bug bounty program is a program where a company or
                organization invites ethical hackers to identify and report
                security vulnerabilities in their systems, applications, and /
                or products. The company offers incentives, usually in the form
                of financial rewards, for the responsible reporting of
                vulnerabilities.The purpose of the program is to improve the
                security of the company's assets by finding and fixing
                vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious
                actors. Public bug bounty programs are often used by software
                companies, but any organization can participate.{" "}
